> Team Name: Next-Gen Builders

Next-Gen Skillforge is an AI-powered career intelligence dashboard built with Next.js. It analyzes public profile links and resume content, extracts skill signals, generates role-fit insights, and creates a personalized learning roadmap.

## Core Functionality

- Link-based profile analysis (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio, resume URL, Twitter, Dev.to).
- Resume upload and parsing (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) with detected skill keywords.
- AI-generated outputs:
	- Technical and soft skill scoring.
	- Summary, strengths, and growth gaps.
	- Industry relevance score.
	- ATS score with actionable feedback (when resume text is available).
	- Job recommendations with match percentage and fit reason.
	- Prioritized learning path with resource links.
- Downloadable PDF report from analyzed profile data.
- Session-backed persistence for preferences and last valid analysis.
- Optional profile snapshot export to generated TypeScript/JSON files.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Recharts
- iron-session
- Axios + Cheerio
- pdf-parse + mammoth

```

## UX Flow

1. Add professional links and/or import a resume file.
2. Run profile analysis.
3. Review skill graphs, recommendations, ATS feedback, and learning path.
4. Download the generated PDF report.
5. Return later with session-restored preferences and analysis (when link signature matches).

## Notes

- URL handling includes SSRF-focused safeguards (no localhost/private network targets).
- Session data is cookie-backed and encrypted via `iron-session`.
- Resume ATS scoring is most useful after successful resume import.
- Snapshot files are generated artifacts and can be regenerated anytime.
